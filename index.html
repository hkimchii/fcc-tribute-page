            >South Korea has a new idol - a giant genderless penguin with a
            gruff voice, a brazen attitude and a hunger for fame.</strong
          ><br />
          Its name is Pengsoo, and by most normal mascot measures, it's not
          cute.<br />
          It tells people not to cheer it up, is often decked in sunglasses and
          its voice sounds like that of a middle aged man despite being 10 years
          old.<br />
          Yet the expressionless giant penguin, which was initially aimed at
          children, has now gained a large fan base amongst many millennials who
          find its blunt personality refreshing.<br />
          The 2.1m giant penguin was even named South Korea's "Person of the
          Year" - despite obviously not being a person - even beating contenders
          like K-pop phenomenon BTS.
