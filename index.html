            >South Korea has a new idol - a giant genderless penguin with a
            gruff voice, a brazen attitude and a hunger for fame.</strong
          ><br />
          Its name is Pengsoo, and by most normal mascot measures, it's not
          cute.<br />
          It tells people not to cheer it up, is often decked in sunglasses and
          its voice sounds like that of a middle aged man despite being 10 years
          old.<br />
          Yet the expressionless giant penguin, which was initially aimed at
          children, has now gained a large fan base amongst many millennials who
          find its blunt personality refreshing.<br />
          The 2.1m giant penguin was even named South Korea's "Person of the
          Year" - despite obviously not being a person - even beating contenders
          like K-pop phenomenon BTS.

          The 10-year-old penguin is originally from the Antarctic, but made its
          way to South Korea to become a star, according to Pengsoo's creators,
          the Education Broadcassting System (EBS)<br />
          Its goal, they said, were to emulate Pororo, the cute goggle-wearing
          charcter loved by children all across the country. It also wanted to
          be more popular than BTS. <br /><br />
          It's "it" because Pengsoo is neither male nor female - EBS, where
          Pengsoo is officially working as a trainee, are keen to stress that
          point.

        <p class="body2-text-content">
          EBS producer Lee Seulyena told the
          <strong>BBC News Korea</strong> that the character was created to be
          someone the "whole family could like".<br />
          The giant penguin went on to become a hit with young adults in their
          20s and 30s, resulting in
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtckgmUcpzqGnzcs7xEqMzQ"
            ><strong
              >The EBS YouTube channel that features Pengsoo, Giant Peng
              TV</strong
            ></a
          >
          reaching over 1.2 million subscribers. Pengsoo is also a popular guest
          on talk shows and TV programmes.<br /><br />
          So what's the appeal?<br /><br />
          The company behind Pengsoo says its appeal lies in its ability to "not
          be tied to heirarchy or rank" but yet still hold a form of "childlike
          innocence".<br />
          In multiple videos, it refers to the chief of EBS Kim Myung-joong
          without the expected honorific "Sajangnim" - a term of respect used to
          refer to someone older or in a higher position.<br />
          It also often jokingly blames Mr Kim when something goes wrong, akin
          to someone blaming their boss for all their problems.<br />
          But Pengsoo treats everyone equally whether its counterpart is a
          lawmaker, a company president, or a famous celebrity. This is what's
          really charming about Pengsoo.<br /><br />
          So don't be surprised if you soon see a giant gruffy penguin pop up
          around you, it's just Pengsoo.
